# sde_benchmarks
This repository aims to perform a benchmark of different numerical methods to solve stochastic differential equations : Euler, Milestein ,RK, Taylor
Stability, convergence-speed and precision shall be compared for each numerical scheme
The benchmark SDE are those of HESTON model with stochastic volatility
This project is on going ..
